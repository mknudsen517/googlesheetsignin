Google Sheet Sign In System

For use with google sheets using a sheet named "Working Sheet", where a list of students can be pasted from a scheduler report, etc, and a column (in this case col 4) contains a checkbox to reflect if the student attended
Master Game Plan is a query of data in a viewable format to see who is scheduled and who has attended. Includes buttons for classroom 1 and classroom 2 to sign in students (bypassing tabbing over to the working sheet).
